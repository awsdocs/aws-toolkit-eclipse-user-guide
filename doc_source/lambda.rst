Using |LAMlong| with the |tke|
##############################

The |tke| provides support for authoring code for `AWS Lambda <http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_.
|LAM| is a fully managed compute service that runs your code in response to events generated by
custom code or from various AWS services such as |S3|, |DDB|, |AK|, |SNS|, and |COG|. For more
information about |LAM|, see the |LAM-dg|_.

This section of the |tke-ug| focuses on how you can use features of the |tke| to create, deploy and
